# 🔍 GitHub Pages Deployment Diagnosis

## ❌ Current Issue: "Process completed with exit code 1"

This error typically occurs when GitHub Pages is not properly configured. Let's diagnose step by step:

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Enable GitHub Pages First**

### Step 1: Check Repository Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/pages
2. **What do you see?**
   - ❌ "Pages" section not visible? → Repository might not have Pages enabled
   - ❌ "Source: None"? → Pages not configured
   - ❌ "Source: Deploy from a branch"? → Wrong! Should be "GitHub Actions"
   - ✅ "Source: GitHub Actions"? → Good! Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Verify Environment
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/environments
2. **Look for "github-pages" environment:**
   - ❌ Not visible? → Create it manually
   - ✅ Visible? → Check if it has protection rules

### Step 3: Check Repository Permissions
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/actions
2. **Verify:**
   - ✅ "Actions permissions" is set to "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
   - ✅ "Workflow permissions" is set to "Read and write permissions"

## 🔧 **Manual Fix Steps:**

### If Pages is not enabled:
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**

### If github-pages environment is missing:
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/environments
2. Click **"New environment"**
3. Name: `github-pages`
4. Click **"Configure environment"**
5. Click **"Save protection rules"** (leave empty)

### If Actions are restricted:
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/actions
2. Set "Actions permissions" to **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
3. Set "Workflow permissions" to **"Read and write permissions"**
4. Click **Save**

## 🎯 **After Configuration:**

1. **Trigger a new deployment:**
   - Make a small change to any file
   - Commit and push: `git add . && git commit -m "Test deployment" && git push`

2. **Check the workflow:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/actions
   - Look for the new run

3. **Your site should be live at:**
   ```
   https://mostafa-nasr-4277.github.io/CorridorOS
   ```

## 🆘 **If Still Failing:**

The issue might be with the repository structure. Let's try a different approach:
- Use "Deploy from a branch" instead of "GitHub Actions"
- Or create a minimal test deployment
