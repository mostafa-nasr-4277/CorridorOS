# Tactile Power Toolkit

Genderless, tactile (pad-to-pad, magnet-aligned) power transmission design tools — plus inductive and capacitive calculators.
This toolkit packages sizing calculators, clearance/creepage heuristics, pre‑charge sequencing, tile SVG generator,
and a small simulation harness for connect/disconnect cycles.

> Use this to draft designs, then validate in your lab and certify against IEC/UL. Heuristics are conservative.

See `pyproject.toml` for install; use `tactile-power --help`.
