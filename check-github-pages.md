# üîß GitHub Pages Configuration Check

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You need to enable GitHub Pages first!

The deployment is failing because GitHub Pages might not be properly configured. Follow these steps:

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **Save**

### 2. Check Repository Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Make sure it shows "GitHub Actions" as the source

### 3. Verify Workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/actions
2. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click on the latest run to see detailed logs

### 4. Check Environment
1. Go to: https://github.com/mostafa-nasr-4277/CorridorOS/settings/environments
2. Make sure "github-pages" environment exists
3. If not, create it with these settings:
   - Name: `github-pages`
   - No protection rules needed for public repos

## üö® Common Issues:

- **GitHub Pages not enabled**: Most common cause of deployment failures
- **Wrong source selected**: Must be "GitHub Actions", not "Deploy from a branch"
- **Missing environment**: The `github-pages` environment must exist
- **Permission issues**: Repository settings might restrict Actions

## ‚úÖ After Configuration:

Your site will be available at:
```
https://mostafa-nasr-4277.github.io/CorridorOS
```

## üîÑ If Still Failing:

1. Check the Actions logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all files are committed and pushed
3. Try running the workflow manually from the Actions tab
